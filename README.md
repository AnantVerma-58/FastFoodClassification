**Project Description:**
Fast Food Image Classification with Deep Learning

This project delves into the exciting domain of image classification, with a specific focus on classifying fast food items. 

**Project Objectives:**

1. **Data Preparation:** We meticulously curated and organized a dataset of fast food images, dividing it into training, validation, and testing sets. All images were resized to a consistent format to ensure uniformity.

2. **Model Selection:** To identify the most effective architecture for our task, we experimented with several deep learning models, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, EfficientNet-V2 M, MobileNet-V2, and DenseNet-201.

3. **Training and Testing:** The selected models underwent rigorous training and testing, with variations in epochs and configurations. The results were meticulously analyzed to gauge each model's performance in terms of loss and accuracy.

4. **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** We visualized and interpreted the confusion matrix to gain insights into class-wise performance, identifying areas of strength and potential for improvement.

5. **DenseNet-201:** Among the models, DenseNet-201 consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving high accuracy and low loss, making it the top performer for this task.

This project showcases the potential of deep learning in image classification and opens doors to a wide array of applications in the fast food industry.
